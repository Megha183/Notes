const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

dotenv package is used to load envirment variables from a .env file into process.env in node js applications.This
helps in managing configuration settings seprately from the code


validation and sanitization
-------------------------
it's essential to validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security risks like SQL 
injection, XSS, and incorrect data storage.

1. Validation in Node.js & MongoDB
Validation ensures that data is correct before saving it to the database.

2. Sanitization in Node.js
allows to alter data before saving it
Sanitization helps remove malicious code (e.g., scripts) from user input.
eg.removing empty spaces around username
