A cookie is a small piece of data stored in a user's browser. 
 Real-Life Example: "Remember Me" in Login System
Imagine you have a login system where users can select "Remember Me" to stay logged in.

If the user checks "Remember Me", the app stores a cookie with their session ID.
Next time the user visits, the app reads the cookie to auto-login the user.Websites use cookies to remember user preferences, session information, or login details.

*A session ID is a unique identifier assigned to a user when they log in or visit a website. It helps the server recognize the user in future requests without asking them to log in again.
Session ID (session_id) is like a visitor pass that websites use to remember you.
It is stored in a cookie and sent with every request so the server can recognize the user.
Once logged out, the session ID is removed to end the session.
