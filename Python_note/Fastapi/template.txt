By default, FastAPI renders a JSON response to the client. However, 
it can be cast to a HTML response. 
For this purpose, FastAPI has HTMLResponse class defined in fastapi.responses module.
 We need to 
add response_class as an additional parameter to operation decorator,
 with HTMLResponse object as its value

------------------
to send a file to the server you need to use the HTML formâ€™s enctype as multipart/form-data, 
and use the input type as the file to render a button, 
which when clicked allows you to select a file from the file system.
<html>
   <body>
      <form action="http://localhost:8000/uploader" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
         <input type="file" name="file" />
         <input type="submit"/>
      </form>
   </body>
</html>
