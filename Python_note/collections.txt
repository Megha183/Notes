dictionary:
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. 
It is used to store data in a structured way where each key is unique.
we can store any data type in dict as values
in keys we cant use lists ,dict-since they are changeable
ddefine empty dict->  empty={}


*they are unoredred ,mutable(cahngeable) and dont allow duplicate keys(they dont have index)

*accessing elements
print(student["name"])
 get() is safer because it returns None if the key is missing, while [] gives an error.

 to print all keys-dict.keys()
 to print all value-dict.values()

set

Sets in Python ðŸŒ€
inside sets duplicate values are ignored
A set in Python is a collection of unique elements. It is unordered, mutable, and does not allow duplicate values.
set is mutable,we can add or remove elements but its elements are immutable
cant store tuple,list in set since they are mutable
nums{1,2,3,4}
*duplicate values are ignored
ddefine empty set->  emptySet=set()



list,dict-mutable
tuple,set-not mutable
